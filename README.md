Various Functional programming language implementations converted from an Object-oriented programming language

C++ to Scheme, Haskell & Prolog.

Consider finite sequences of lists drawn from the finite alphabet	S = {A, C, G, T}
  Given a sequence L, one would like to perform the following tasks: 
  - Compute the length of L
  - Count the number of occurrences in L of each alphabet letter
  - Create a histogram or frequency distribution for L
  - (Extra Credit) Perform a Huffman coding on the L histogram

My choosen L finite sequence is as follows:
L = {P, A, T, F, A, T, C, A, T}
